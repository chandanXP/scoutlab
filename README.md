# Final year project: Product Review System, Product lie Detector

This project analyses the consumers experiences and expectations with the product while making online purchases, examines the supply and demand in the online market as well as the promises made by the company. Amidst the current competitive market environment, customers remain hesitant about various products, making it difficult to distinguish required products from similar products in terms of specifications, price, or quality. Wrong purchases make products lose trust of customers. Product in review is at risk of losing upcoming customers and getting poor reviews. Sentiment analysis has applied to extract the labelled information from online reviews. Over 20000 reviews of 2019 have been analyzed on the basis of customer expectations and delivery. Classification was done based on the customer's requirements matching the company's promises and the decisive factors. Product evaluation, solves the customers' ambiguity and introduces new parameters of judging a product.
